# A SysML Model of the Wireless Factory Work-cell
SysML model of the wireless connected factory workcell.  This model is design for the analysis of factory work-cell architectures and data flows.  Wireless technology is a key enabler of the vision of the future factory work-cell. Such work-cell will operate autonomously with a high degree of mobility enabled by wireless technology.  This paper describes the work-cell using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML)[1].  Using SysML the structural and parametric characteristics of the work-cell are described. Our model provides the architectural components and performance constraints of the work-cell in which wireless is used for a significant portion of connectivity. It identifies the structural components, interfaces, and data flows. Parametric characteristic that impact work-cell performance are included in the model.  Using this model, industrial wireless networking requirements and work-cell behaviors may be developed and performance limits may be evaluated[2].  The SysmL model presented here is developed using MagicDraw 18.4.

To use the model, MagicDraw 18.4 or later with the SysML plugin is required.  An HTML report is included for users that do not have access to the MagicDraw software.
